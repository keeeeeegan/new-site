<p>The Digital Media B.A. program at UCF provided exposure to many aspects of web design and development, including programming languages such as C and Java, as well as design tools such as Illustrator and Photoshop. While attenting the program I worked part-time on campus in various web-development capacities. This combo of theory and experience provided a great education that I'm very lucky to have been a part of.</p>

  <li>Coursework included developing small web applications and websites, utilising API technologies, and working with various programming languages including lower-level languages such as C.</li>
  <li>I was also able to attend a few graphic and web design related courses, which allowed me to practice working with Photoshop and Illustrator. It was also incredibly useful to see other students' work to compare work and get notes on how to improve.</li>
  <li>Some of the electives I was able to attend included iOS application production, API development, and 3D modelling. While mostly introductory, these were interesting and eye-opening to see other areas computer programming and design.</li>
</ul>
