Online learning and educational game system by University of Central Florida. It is a Learning Management System that allows faculty to create and manage educational games, as well as track student progress and participation. Materia and its games are built in-house by the UCF development team I was a part of, New Media.

I worked with team members to help design and build parts of the Materia system, including interactive educational games.
