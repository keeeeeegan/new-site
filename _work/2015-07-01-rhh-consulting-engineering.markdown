This website was built as a Wordpress template. The design was a recreation of the client's lost original design. I recreated the design using Adobe Photoshop.

The site features an audio introduction, which allows the company owner to introduce himself and the site. I implented play controls so that auto-play can be paused or muted (the mute option is saved in a JavaScript cookie).
