This website was created as part of an assignment in a design course at the University of Central Florida. Students were required to create a website based on a movie that was made before the year 1970. I designed the site as well as the logo using Adobe Photoshop.

The site is static, built using PHP for templating. jQuery was utlized to create what I called <code><a href="http://placeholder.keeganberry.com/stuff/rear-window-movie-site/js/blinds.js">blinds.js</a></code>, a transition between pages that renders animated divs in a horizontal pattern to emulate blinds closing/opening. The design also utilizes webfont embedding through Google Web Fonts for the majority of the type.
