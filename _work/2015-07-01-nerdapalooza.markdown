Landing page for Nerdapalooza, built to replace page from previous year. Logo files and photos from previous events were provided. I created the design in Photoshop, PSD sliced where necessary, and used html/css techniques where possible.

I implemented a scrolling ticker to showcase performers for 2013, as well as a dynamically changing "Order Tickets" button that changed based on the days left before the concert.

Bootstrap's CSS was utilized for gridding and layout, which also provided a foundation for the responsive design.
