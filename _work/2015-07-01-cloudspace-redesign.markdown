<span class="lead">Cloudspace is a wed application development shop for startup businesses  located in Orlando near UCF.</span> I worked with Cloudspace company owners to update the design of the Cloudspace website, primarily working with the homepage. The site was originally built using hard-coded php files. This time around, a static site generator (<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>) was utilized to streamline content editing and make the website secure and simple.

Wireframes &amp; copy for the new design was provided to me. From those wireframes I built each section of the homepage in Photoshop, and then created as much of  the design in-browser as possible. Certain assets had to be exported as image files, as you might imagine.
