Internal tool with three domains:

<ol>
  <li>A ticketing system with built-in and configurable workflows,</li>
  <li>A time reporting and task tracking system, and</li>
  <li>A course management system allowing admins to add and remove students/faculty as needed.</li>
</ol>

Helped build features on all three, including UI/UX, frontend, and backend development.
