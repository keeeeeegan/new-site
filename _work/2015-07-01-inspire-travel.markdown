Travel booking site (partnered with Priceline) that allowed users to donate a portion of their ticket price to a charity of their choice. I created the backen as well as the frontend, and incorporated the Priceline Partners hotel booking code snippets to create a user experience similar to Priceline, with the added functionality of choosing one of three charities. Additionally, after booking a flight, the user was prompted to share his or her flight and charity donation on Facebook, Twitter, and a few other social networks.

The backend was built using FuelPHP, an MVC-like PHP framework that allows tools (similar to Rails) like scaffolding and model creation through the command line. I created user login/logout functionality and integrated some simple CMS tools for the purely content pages.

The frontend was built using HTML/CSS in the FuelPHP template format, put together based on designs supplied by the client.
