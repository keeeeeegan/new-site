I'm a web developer and designer working for the <a href="https://brand.ucf.edu/about-ucf-marketing/">Marketing team at the University of Central Florida</a> in Orlando.

I generally work with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS when working on websites and user interfaces. I also work with Adobe products, including Illustrator and Photoshop, to create designs, illustrations, and print media. While meeting clients' needs, I always strive to learn something new, have fun, and improve my skills in creating robust, intuitive, and eye-catching work.

I like traveling, drawing, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/superdeathsquid/">taking photos</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4n_LMyrTE">bikes</a>, and trying one of the thousand new coffee shops / bars in Orlando. I also enjoy cooking, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBPI3oKhyyg">it doesn't always work out</a>.
