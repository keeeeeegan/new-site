<p>Iâ€™m a web developer working on the LMS Integrations team at <a href="https://cdl.ucf.edu">the Center for Distributed Learning at the University of Central Florida</a> in Orlando.</p>

I generally work with JavaScript, HTML, and SASS/CSS when working on websites and user interfaces. Lately, I've been sharpening my Python skills while also learning ReactJS. While meeting clients' needs, I always strive to learn something new, have fun, and improve my skills in creating robust, intuitive, and eye-catching work.

I like traveling, drawing, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/superdeathsquid/">taking photos</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4n_LMyrTE">bikes</a>, and trying one of the thousand new coffee shops/restaurants/bars in Orlando. I also enjoy cooking, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBPI3oKhyyg">it doesn't always work out</a>.
