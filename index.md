# Hello

<span class="lead">I'm Keegan Berry â€” a web developer out of Orlando, Florida.</span>

I work in various web technologies and specialize in CSS &amp; HTML, JavaScript, and Adobe products, which I use to craft and implement websites and interfaces that are snappy, functional, and nice to look at.
